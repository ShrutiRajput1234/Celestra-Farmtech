__Farmer - Giver of the food to the people, to all practical purposes__ <br>
Me and my teammates were curious about farming processes and then slowly we get to knew about it then we found our food providers were facing so many troubles in the field. Farmers are not able to put their doubts, issues to anyone. So, we made a website where farmers can connect to all the nationwide other farmers and can discuss in a website in a forum.
<br>
We have also made a weather analytics and GPS tracking technologies in a website for the better yield and for the better life of farmers.
