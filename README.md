<h3>Farmer - Giver of the food to the people, to all practical purposes.<br>
Me and my teammates were curious about farming processes and then slowly we get to knew about it then we found our food providers were facing so many troubles in the field. Farmers are not able to put their doubts, issues to anyone. So, we made a website where farmers can connect to all the nationwide other farmers and can discuss in a website in a forum .<br> we have also made a weather analytics and GPS tracking technologies in a website for the better yield and for the better life of farmers .</h3>

<h3>
Using  GPS-based applications in-line with smart machinery to optimize fertilizer and pesticide application; given that farmers are able to map current and future changes in precipitation, temperature, crop yields, plant health , soil condition and so on . So, our team is working on this idea and we are trying to implement this practically .
